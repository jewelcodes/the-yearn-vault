# The Yearn Vault
**[The Yearn Vault](https://theyearnvault.com/)** is a personal project meant to anonymously archive the affirmations and texts users wanted to receive but never did. Owing to [the Unsent Project](https://theunsentproject.com/) as inspiration after submitting a message there myself, I wondered why the opposite idea of it hadn't already been done, so I did it myself.
